          SB Admin 2 makes extensive use of Bootstrap 4 utility classes in order
          to reduce CSS bloat and poor page performance. Custom CSS classes are
          used to create custom components and custom utility classes.
        </p>
        <p>
          Before working with this theme, you should become familiar with the
          Bootstrap framework, especially the utility classes.

    </div>
